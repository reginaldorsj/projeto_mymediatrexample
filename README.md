# My MediatR Example

Recently, I was introduced to the Mediator Pattern and I decided to write some project that could implement this pattern. If you want to learn more about the Mediator Pattern, access this site [https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator). Therefore, it borned **My MediatR Example project**. This project name was choose because I decide to use the MediatR library as a implementation facilitator of this pattern. In addition to this library, I used the following resources: 

- WebAPI in ASP.NET Core 5 to build the Back-End API
- NHibernate ORM to access Firebird Database
- Tier Application
- Clean Architeture

The code is very simple. If some of you have any doubts, please let me know.
